	 * 1. Encapsulation 
	 * 2. Inheritance 
	 * 3. polymorphism 
	 * 4. Abstraction 
	 
	 
	     4 type of access modifier in Java we use before variable or method
	     
	     1. private   // private int age; 
	     2. default    // int age ; 
	     3. protected  // protected int age; 
	     4. public     // public int age;

	/**
	      Data Hiding
	  
	   1. Encapsulation is a process of packaging Variables and methods into a
	   single unit.
	  
	   2. Protecting data by declaring them as private.
	   
	   3. in order to access private data or hiding data we need to use set and get method 
	  
	   4. Benefit of Encapsulation
	  
	  			* Provides data hiding 
	  			* reusability
	  			* code can be modified without breaking the code
	  			* maintainability: hiding implementation details reduces complexity 
	  			*
