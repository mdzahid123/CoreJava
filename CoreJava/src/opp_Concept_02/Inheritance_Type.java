	/**
	 	1. single inheritance 
	 	
	 	class A ---> class B
	 	
	 	in this sort of inheritance, 
	 	One subclass inherits form one superclass 
	 	-------------------------------------------------------------
	 	
	 	
	 	2. Multilevel inheritance: 
	 
	 	class A ---> class B ----> class C	 
	 	
	 	For C, B is the super class 
	 	and for A, B is the Sub class. 
	 	
	 	In this sort of inheritance, 
	 	The super class for one is the subclass for other. 
	 -------------------------------------------------------------	
	 	
	 	3. Hierarchical inheritance 
	 	
	 	      |------------------------|
	 		  |                        |
	 		  |				A		   |   Class A 
	 		  | 					   |

	 		When Multiple subclass derived form single superclass 
	 		
	  -------------------------------------------------------------        
	 
	  4. Multiple inheritance
	  
	  Java does not support multiple inheritance: 
	  
	  for example: Class A,  B,  C  
	               
	   					Class D, class D can inherite info form one class only 
	   					from the top.
