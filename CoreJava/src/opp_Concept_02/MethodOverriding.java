	  Declaring a method in subclass which is already present in superclass 
	  is known as method overriding. 
	  
	  1. code resue
	  2. one interface, multiple implement
	  3. run time polymorphism
	  
	  
	  3 rules of overriding: 
	  
	  1. name, signature type, parameter must be same 
	  2. if a method can't be inherited, then its can't be overridden
	  3. A method declared as final or static can't be overridden
	  
	  and ** CONSTRUCTOR method can't be overridden
